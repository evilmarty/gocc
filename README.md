Credit Card validator, in Go
============================

This is my first attempt at the [Go programming language](http://golang.org), so it reeks of newbie. The problem tackled is the typical Credit Card validator; Supply a number and it will output the Credit Card type along with whether it is valid or not. Not the most complex problem but good to let dabble with the language.

The goal of this exercise was to use as much of the language that the average user might use. That includes objects, maps, slices, and tests. I did want to also make use of closures but didn't want to go too far out with the implementation.

Usage
=====

1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure you have the Go compiler installed
3. Run `go run src/main.go`
